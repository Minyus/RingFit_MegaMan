### Disclaimer

I shall not be liable for any damage to your body or hardware/software products you use following the instruction below.
The following steps worked for me (after struggling), but I can not guarantee in other cases.

0. Prepare hardware

    - [Nintendo Switch, Dock, and Joy-Cons](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/)
    - [Ring-Con and leg strap that comes with Ring Fit Adventure](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ring-fit-adventure-switch/)

    - [Titan Two](https://www.consoletuner.com/products/titan-two/)
    - [Titan Expansion Kit](https://www.consoletuner.com/products/titan-two/) (to connect Joy-Cons with Titan Two via Bluetooth)

    - PC (Windows 64bit (10, 8.1, 7) or Mac (OS X 10.13+) computer)
    - Additional Micro-USB cable (A Micro-USB cable comes with Titan Two, but you will need one more to connect both PC and 
    Nintendo Switch Dock. I could use an old Micro-USB cable used to charge my old Android smart phone.)

1. Purchase and download [Mega Man Legacy Collection](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mega-man-legacy-collection-switch/) to your Nintendo Switch.

2. Turn on "Pro Controller Wired Communication" in Nintendo Switch following the [instruction](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Enable-Disable-Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Wired-Communication-1516284.html) to use Titan Two later.

3. Download and Install [Gtuner IV](https://www.consoletuner.com/downloads/?) to your Windows or Mac computer.

4. Install Titan Expansion Kit to Titan Two and connect to your PC (using "PROG" connector of Titan Two) following the [instruction](https://www.consoletuner.com/wiki/index.php?id=t2:expansion_kit). Don't forget [First Time Configuration](https://www.consoletuner.com/wiki/index.php?id=t2:expansion_kit#first_time_configuration)!

5. Pair up the 2 Joy-cons with Titan Two following [instruction](https://www.consoletuner.com/wiki/index.php?id=t2:usage_guides:controllers:switch). You may need to sleep Nintendo Switch to avoid the Joy-cons paired up with Nintendo Switch unexpectedly. 

6. Download and Install [ringfit_megaman.gpc](https://github.com/Minyus/RingFit_MegaMan/blob/master/ringfit_megaman.gpc) script to a memory slot (e.g. 1) of Titan Two following the [instruction](https://www.consoletuner.com/wiki/index.php?id=t2:gpc_scripting).

7. Connect Titan Two to your Nintendo Switch Dock (using "Output" connector of Titan Two). Use an additional Micro-USB cable if you have so you can monitor the signals from Joy-Cons in Gtuner IV application. Otherwise, you need to disconnect the Micro-USB cable that connects Titan Two and PC.

8. Install the 2 Joy-Cons to Ring-Con and leg strap, respectively.
