## Instruction to set up

### Disclaimer

I shall not be liable for any damage to your body or hardware/software products you use following the instruction below.
The following steps worked for me (after struggling), but I can not guarantee in other cases.

0. Prepare hardware

    - [Nintendo Switch, Dock, and Joy-Cons](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/)
    - [Ring Fit Adventure controller (Ring-Con and leg strap)](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/ring-fit-adventure-switch/)

    - [Titan Two](https://www.consoletuner.com/products/titan-two/)
    - [Titan Expansion Kit](https://www.consoletuner.com/products/titan-two/) (to connect Joy-Cons with Titan Two via Bluetooth)

    - PC (Windows 64bit (10, 8.1, 7) or Mac (OS X 10.13+) computer)
    - Additional Micro-USB cable (A Micro-USB cable comes with Titan Two, but you will need one more to connect both PC and 
    Nintendo Switch Dock. I could use an old Micro-USB cable used to charge my old Android smart phone.)

1. Purchase and download [Mega Man Legacy Collection](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mega-man-legacy-collection-switch/) to your Nintendo Switch.

2. Turn on "Pro Controller Wired Communication" in Nintendo Switch following the [instruction](https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Enable-Disable-Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Wired-Communication-1516284.html) to recognize Titan Two in the later step.

3. Download and Install [Gtuner IV](https://www.consoletuner.com/downloads/?) to your PC (Windows or Mac computer).

4. Install Titan Expansion Kit to Titan Two and connect Titan Two (Micro-USB port labeled "PROG") to your PC following the [instruction](https://www.consoletuner.com/wiki/index.php?id=t2:expansion_kit). [Note] Don't forget [First Time Configuration](https://www.consoletuner.com/wiki/index.php?id=t2:expansion_kit#first_time_configuration)!

5. Sleep Nintendo Switch to avoid the Joy-Cons directly paired up with Nintendo Switch unexpectedly. 

6. Pair up the 2 Joy-Cons (one by one) with Titan Two via Bluetooth following [instruction](https://www.consoletuner.com/wiki/index.php?id=t2:usage_guides:controllers:switch). Pairing Method B using Gtuner IV is recommended. If you choose Pairing Method A, please note that UP button is the button located in the right side of the number LED and labeled (misleading) down-pointing triangle. Once the 2 Joy-Cons are paired up with Titan Two, `Joy-Con Right [IN]` and `Joy-Con Left [IN]` should appear in the "Device Monitor" tab of Gtuner IV's GUI.

7. Download and Install a GPC script ([ringfit_megaman_squatbuster.gpc](https://github.com/Minyus/RingFit_MegaMan/blob/master/ringfit_megaman_squatbuster.gpc) or [ringfit_megaman_squatjump.gpc](https://github.com/Minyus/RingFit_MegaMan/blob/master/ringfit_megaman_squatjump.gpc)) to a memory slot (e.g. 1) of Titan Two following the [instruction](https://www.consoletuner.com/wiki/index.php?id=t2:gpc_scripting).

8. Connect Titan Two (Micro-USB port labeled "OUTPUT") to your Nintendo Switch Dock (one of the USB ports). Use an additional Micro-USB cable if you have so you can monitor the signals from Joy-Cons in Gtuner IV application's GUI. Otherwise, you need to disconnect the Micro-USB cable that connects Titan Two and PC, which is not recommended.

9. Wake up Nintendo Switch by pressing the power button. 

10. Press the UP button on Titan Two once to activate. Nintendo Switch should recognize Titan Two as a Pro controller connected via USB.

11. Set the number indicated by LED on Titan Two to "0" by pressing the UP button once or more times to use the Joy-Cons with the installed GPC program disabled.

12. Start Mega Man in Nintendo Switch.

13. Install the 2 Joy-Cons to Ring-Con and leg strap, respectively.

14. Set the number indicated by LED on Titan Two to the memory slot number (e.g. 1) by pressing the UP button once or more times to enable the installed GPC program.

15. Enjoy!
